# dnaviewer
Browser Based Viewer of DNA, implemented by Moncho Pena.

## Introduction
This repository implements a very simple single page application (SPA) that renders a diagram
and table given some JSON data about a piece of DNA. DNA sequences have particular subsegments that have a special
function. These are called DNA Features. The goal is to show a scientist the Dna Features in a particular DNA
molecule. One way of doing this is with a set of symbols called Synthetic Biology Open Language Visual (SBOL Visual).
Check it out here: http://www.sbolstandard.org/visual
A quick Google Search for "Plasmid Diagram" (plasmids are a type of circular DNA molecule) will show you many different
designs.

## Notes

###23-02-2015 Part I

- First I represented JSON in a table, ordered by positions. So I could understand the data

- For the representation of the molecule the best way is to make a circle.

- I tried to represent the molecule with D3 but I think it's better with pure SVG.

- This project AngularPlasmid (http://angularplasmid.vixis.com/) has given me very good ideas.

- At the moment I've only had time to test and understand the operation of "path" command to make the arches. SVG usability is not obvious.

- Now I know the tools. Next chapter soon ...

- Arc and image showed
